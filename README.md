# TODO FIND A GOOD NAME

## Description
This tool takes in a list of ca id's from crt.sh, and outputs a list of domains it can find from those CA ID's.

I made it to show how some AWS resources can be enumerated using certificate transparency logs and viewing certificates issued by the Amazon root CAs.
